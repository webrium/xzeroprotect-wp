## What is this?

Most security plugins tell you how many requests they blocked. This one also tells you how many **real humans** actually visited your site — because it filters bot traffic before recording anything.

xZeroProtect for WordPress brings the [xZeroProtect PHP firewall library](https://github.com/webrium/xzeroprotect) into WordPress with a clean admin dashboard, database-backed analytics, and settings that make sense.

---

## Features

### 🛡 Firewall

- Blocks bots, scanners, and exploit tools by User-Agent signature
- Detects and blocks SQLi, XSS, path traversal, LFI/RFI, and command injection in request payloads
- Blocks requests to sensitive paths (`.env`, `phpmyadmin`, web shells, config files, and more)
- Rate-limits IPs with a sliding-window counter — no Redis required
- Auto-bans repeat offenders; escalates to permanent ban after N violations
- Verifies legitimate crawlers (Googlebot, Bingbot, and others) via **double-DNS** before granting trust — so search engine crawlers are never accidentally blocked
- Syncs permanent bans to `.htaccess` so Apache rejects them before PHP runs (optional)

### 📊 Real Visitor Analytics

- Tracks only traffic that passed **all** firewall checks — bots and scanners never appear in your stats
- Unique visitor identification via daily-resetting SHA-256 fingerprint (privacy-safe — raw IPs are never stored in the fingerprint)
- Per-visit: browser, browser version, OS, OS version, device type (desktop / mobile / tablet)
- Traffic overview chart with 7 / 14 / 30-day range selector
- Top pages by total hits and unique visitors
- Device breakdown with visual bars
- Block reason breakdown (rate limit, bad User-Agent, payload attack, banned IP, and more)
- Real visitor log and blocked request log with full detail

### ⚙️ Settings

- Firewall mode: **Production** (block + log) · **Learning** (log only) · **Off**
- Toggle each detection module independently
- Whitelist IPs (exact or CIDR) and paths
- Configure rate-limit window and threshold
- Configure auto-ban duration and escalation
- Choose block response HTTP code (403 / 429 / 503)
- Data retention — old records pruned automatically via WP-Cron
- WordPress core paths (`/wp-admin`, `/wp-login.php`, `/wp-json`) are always safe — you can never lock yourself out

Only requests that reach step 8 without being blocked are recorded as real visits.

## Data & Privacy

- Visitor fingerprints are SHA-256 hashes of IP + User-Agent + date — the raw IP cannot be recovered from them
- Fingerprints reset daily — no long-term cross-session tracking
- All data is stored in your own WordPress database — nothing is sent externally
- Data is automatically pruned after the configured retention period (default: 30 days)
- All data is removed cleanly when the plugin is deleted
